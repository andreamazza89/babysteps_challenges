# Babysteps challenges
This repo contains my attempts to solve katas using the baby steps chalenge
approach as described at a Software Craftmanship Community meetup; see the slides
[here] (http://www.slideshare.net/davidvoelkel/baby-steps-tdd-approaches).

The rules are simple: you have a kata to solve and a time limit for each
iteration of moving from red to green. If the time limit is reached and the current
test does not pass, you start over from the previous green state. The time limit
suggested is two minutes but this might be adjusted if too unreasonable.

The purpose of this exercise is to prove that moving in small steps rather than 
leaps makes for a more linear, consistent and -in the long term- faster approach
than taking 'big leaps'.

Have fun!
